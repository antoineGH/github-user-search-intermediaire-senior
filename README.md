This system is provisioned to be built in TypeScript using React library which is highly flexible.

The browser will be in charge of rendering this application in its final form, HTML. Some of the logic involved in creating the web page, especially the one in charge of dealing with presentation logic is handled on the client-side.

List of frontend dependencies and version used:

    - react: V18.2.0,
    - react-dom: V18.2.0,
    - react-scripts: 5.0.1,
    - typescript: V4.8.4,

## 5. Software Interfaces<a name="soft-interfaces"></a>

Software is designed in small fragmented atomic components. Each component has specific functionality and assembled together creates our application.

This is easier to maintain, replace, and re-use.

Communication is assured to external interfaces. The system is connected to GitHub APIs using REST, The payload is defined in the request itself and is formatted in JSON.
